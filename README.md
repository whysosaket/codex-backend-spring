## Overview

The Codex Backend - Spring is a Spring Boot application that serves as the backend for the Codex Iter website. It provides two main endpoints, 'events' and 'members,' allowing for the retrieval and management of event data and member information. This backend is designed to work seamlessly with the Codex Iter website frontend, providing the necessary API services for the platform.

## Endpoints

### 1. Events

- **GET /events:** Retrieve a list of events.

### 2. Members

- **GET /members:** Retrieve a list of members.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the Codex Backend - Spring, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- Database setup (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2 for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codex-backend-spring.git
   cd codex-backend-spring
   ```

2. Configure your database settings in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/codex-backend-spring-1.0.0.jar
   ```

## Usage

Once the Codex Backend - Spring is up and running, it provides RESTful API endpoints to manage events and members for the Codex Iter website. You can use these endpoints to interact with the database and serve data to the frontend.

Example API requests using tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or `axios` can be made to these endpoints for data retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion.

For detailed information on how to interact with the API, please refer to the API documentation or the Codex Iter website documentation.
